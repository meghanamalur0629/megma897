	<!--Paragraph 1: overview of project and what project entails-->
	<p>
	    Hello everyone! Welcome to my home page! This is a project that
		I created for my CSE 2221 Software I class. This web page will include
		some interesting, important, and random facts about myself, hence the
		name "Meghana's Home Page". I hope that you enjoy reading through this
		page and learning more about who I am as an individual. I'll start off with a 
		table that details some basic details about myself, then include a list of random 
		and fun facts with some links included, and finish off with a picture of mine. I hope you
		enjoy looking through my web page!
